# Face Artifact Removal GAN

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** designed to restore facial details, remove artifacts created by **video compression algorithms**, and enhance **face recognition accuracy** on compressed or low-quality video frames.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Video compression often introduces blocky artifacts and loss of fine details, especially on faces. These distortions can significantly reduce the accuracy of **face recognition systems** that rely on clean, high-quality inputs.  

This project uses a GAN-based approach to **reconstruct high-quality, artifact-free facial images**, thereby **improving the robustness and performance of face recognition models** on degraded or compressed videos.  

The model learns to distinguish between real and compression-affected images, gradually improving its ability to restore natural facial features while maintaining visual realism.
